# üí∞Save-It

A web app that helps you maximise your savings with Programmable Banking.

- Save-It allows you to set the minumum and maximum amount that you wish to maintain in your current account (you set the rules)
- It also allows you to set the frequency at which you want the rules to run (every 10 min, 20 min or 30 min)
- Once you set the rules, Save-it will automatically transfer the optimal amount between your current and savings account and maintain this at the frequency that you set.
- Save-It uses the [Investec Transfer API](https://developer.investec.com/za/api-products).

Note: Save-It uses a cron job to run the rules at the frequency that you set. This means that you will need to keep the app running in the background for the rules to run and for the money to continue to be transferred between your accounts.
